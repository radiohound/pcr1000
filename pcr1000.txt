 10.7 MHZ IF Output

 The buffered 10.7 MHz IF Output is available at the emmiter of transistor of Q85.
 Q85 is located close to the edge of the large board, near J1. If you place the radio
 with the antenna connection to the left, Q85 is the first transisor to the right of
 the smaller IF filter at the top lefhand corner of the RF board. This is directly
 above the metal can for one of the LO's. The emmitter is the upper left terminal
 (if the radio is oriented as described above). There will be a DC level at this point,
 so will want a coupling capacitor. (Thanks to gr8amp in the forums)
